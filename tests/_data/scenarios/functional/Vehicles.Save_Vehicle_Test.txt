I WANT TO CREATE A NEW VEHICLE

I am on page '/Intranet/admin' 
I click 'Vehículos'," '.list-group-item' 
I see current url equals '/Intranet/vehicles/list' 
I click '#submit'," '#addVehicle' 
I see current url equals '/Intranet/vehicles/form' 
I submit form('#vehicle form', array  '...",'..."," ..."," ..."," ..."," ..."," ..."," ..."," ..."," ..."," ..."," ..."," ..."," ...","00€'," ...","00€'," ...","00€'," ...","00€'," ...","00€'," ...","00€'," ..." 
I grab from database('vehicles', 'id', array 'plate' => $matricula"," 'vin' => $bastidor)" 
I can see 'Saved'
